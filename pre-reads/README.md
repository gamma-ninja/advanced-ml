# Preparation materials for the BCG training.

The first material to read for day 1 is `pandas`. It contains
some background on the `pandas` software library.

The second one for day 2 is `logreg_sgd`. It contains some background
on logistic regression and stochastic gradient descent.

It is **important** that you have read these notebooks before the training
session.

You will be able to ask questions on the materials during the training.
