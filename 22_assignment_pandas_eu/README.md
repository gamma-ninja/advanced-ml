# Assignment for the Advanced ML training @ BCG Gamma

## What we want you to check that you know how to do by doing this assignment:

  - Use Git and GitHub
  - Work with Python files (and not just notebooks!)
  - Do a pull request on a GitHub repository
  - Format your code properly using standard Python conventions
  - Make your code pass tests run automatically on a continuous integration system (GitHub actions)

## How?

  - For the repository by clicking on the `Fork` button on the upper right corner
  - Clone the repository of your fork with: `git clone https://github.com/MYLOGIN/assignment_pandas` (replace MYLOGIN with your GitHub login)
  - Create a branch called `myassignment-MYLOGIN` using `git checkout -b myassignment-MYLOGIN`
  - Make the changes to complete the assignment. You have to modify the files that contain `questions` in their name. Do not modify the files that start with `test_`.
  - Open the pull request on GitHub
  - Keep pushing to your branch until the continuous integration system is green.
  - When it is green notify the instructors on Slack that your done.

# Your mission

- You have 4 questions to complete. It corresponds to implementing the 4 functions
  whose name starts with the letter "q" in `pandas_questions.py`.

## Getting Help

If you need help ask on the Slack of the training.
